=================

Next-UI Sliding Popup.

----

## Usage

Create a div that looks like this:

```html
<div class="n-sliding-popup" data-n-component="n-sliding-popup" data-n-sliding-popup-position="bottom right">
</div>
```

You can also create an instance of this with the following:

```js
new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
```

### Opening the Popup

If you have a `SlidingPopup` instance, simply call `.open()`:

```js
sp = new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
sp.open();
```

If you do not, then you'll need to set the `data-n-sliding-popup-visible`
attribute manually:

```js
el = document.querySelector('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
el.setAttribute('data-n-sliding-popup-visible', 'true');
```

### Closing the Popup

You can add a close button by making a sub-element with `data-n-component="n-sliding-popup-close"`:

```html
<div class="n-sliding-popup" data-n-component="n-sliding-popup" data-n-sliding-popup-position="bottom right">
  <button class="n-sliding-popup-close" data-n-component="n-sliding-popup-close">
    <span class="n-sliding-popup-close-label">Close</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

This will Just Workâ„¢ and close the popup on click. Again, the button must have
`data-n-component="n-sliding-popup-close"` for functionality. Be sure to add the
`n-sliding-popup-close` class for the CSS styles. `n-sliding-popup-close-label`
can be used to style text that is visible only to screen readers.

If you want your own button, then it should use `SlidingPopup#close`, for example:

```js
sp = new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
sp.close();
```

You can also simply remove the `data-n-sliding-popup-visible` attribute - but
this will not fire the additional event handlers described below...

### Doing things on Close

There are 3 ways to add handlers for closing. You can simply add the old-school
`onClose` attribute to the element:

```js
el = document.querySelector('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
el.onClose = (event) => {
  event.detail.target === el;
  event.detail.instance instanceof SlidingPopup;
};
```

`onClose` can also be set on the SlidingPopup el:

```js
sp = new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
sp.onClose = (event) => {
  event.detail.instance === sp;
  event.detail.target === sp.el;
};
```

Of course the "proper" way to do this is with event listeners, like you would
normal DOM elements. Just listen for the "close" event on the main component:

```js
el = document.querySelector('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
el.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
  event.detail.target === el;
  event.detail.instance instanceof SlidingPopup;
});
```
