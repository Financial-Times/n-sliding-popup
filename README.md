As of May 2023 n-sliding-popup has been ingested into n-live-chat (it was the only consumer of this module). If you find yourself in need of something similar, please contact the Accounts team to discuss your use case and we can see if we can put forward a joint origami component proposal. 

This was an experimental origami component. The sliding popup component was maintained by the accounts team. It was designed to allow a wrapped component to slide up from the bottom of the page when triggered, providing an interactive user experience
----

## Installation
Run `npm install`

## Running demo
Run `npx origami-build-tools dev`. This will serve a demo on localhost, as well as on your network (the output in the terminal will give you the links).
## Usage

Create a div that looks like this:

```html
<div class="n-sliding-popup" data-n-component="n-sliding-popup" data-n-sliding-popup-position="bottom right">
</div>
```

You can also create an instance of this with the following:

```js
new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
```

### Opening the Popup

If you have a `SlidingPopup` instance, simply call `.open()`:

```js
sp = new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
sp.open();
```

If you do not, then you'll need to set the `data-n-sliding-popup-visible`
attribute manually:

```js
el = document.querySelector('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
el.setAttribute('data-n-sliding-popup-visible', 'true');
```

### Closing the Popup

You can add a close button by making a sub-element with `data-n-component="n-sliding-popup-close"`:

```html
<div class="n-sliding-popup" data-n-component="n-sliding-popup" data-n-sliding-popup-position="bottom right">
  <button class="n-sliding-popup-close" data-n-component="n-sliding-popup-close">
    <span class="n-sliding-popup-close-label">Close</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

This will Just Workâ„¢ and close the popup on click. Again, the button must have
`data-n-component="n-sliding-popup-close"` for functionality. Be sure to add the
`n-sliding-popup-close` class for the CSS styles. `n-sliding-popup-close-label`
can be used to style text that is visible only to screen readers.

If you want your own button, then it should use `SlidingPopup#close`, for example:

```js
sp = new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
sp.close();
```

You can also simply remove the `data-n-sliding-popup-visible` attribute - but
this will not fire the additional event handlers described below...

### Doing things on Close

There are 3 ways to add handlers for closing. You can simply add the old-school
`onClose` attribute to the element:

```js
el = document.querySelector('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
el.onClose = (event) => {
  event.detail.target === el;
  event.detail.instance instanceof SlidingPopup;
};
```

`onClose` can also be set on the SlidingPopup el:

```js
sp = new SlidingPopup('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
sp.onClose = (event) => {
  event.detail.instance === sp;
  event.detail.target === sp.el;
};
```

Of course the "proper" way to do this is with event listeners, like you would
normal DOM elements. Just listen for the "close" event on the main component:

```js
el = document.querySelector('#some-el-which-is-a-sliding-popup');
el.addEventListener('close', (event) => {
  event.detail.target === el;
  event.detail.instance instanceof SlidingPopup;
});
```
